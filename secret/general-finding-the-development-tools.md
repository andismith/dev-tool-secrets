<p>If Developer Tools are a complete secret to you, you may have had difficulty finding them!</p>

<p>As well as a menu shortcut, you can access the Developer Tools easily either pressing "F12" in Windows or "Cmd" ⌘, "Option" ⌥ and "I" on the Mac, or by right clicking on the page and selecting “Inspect Element”.

<p class="safari">In Safari, you will need to enable the Developer Tools by checking the option in Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Show Develop Menu first.</p>

<p class="firebug">Since Firebug is an extension for Firefox, you will need to install the add on from <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">http://getfirebug.com/</a></p>
