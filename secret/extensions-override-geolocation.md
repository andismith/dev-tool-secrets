<p>In Firefox, the API location can be overidden like in Chrome. In this case, you have to rely on the Geolocater addon. Install it from the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/geolocater/">official Mozilla addon website</a>.</p>
<p>After installation, go to "Tools" menu, "Geolocater", "Manage". From here, you will be able to directly add a "fake" geolocation by browsing a map or searching place. After, you will be able to override geolocation and switch between predefined geolocations. You can confirm the behaviour, going to the <a href="http://html5demos.com/geo">html5demos for Geolocation</a> </p>
