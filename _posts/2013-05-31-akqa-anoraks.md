title: AKQA Anoraks

<p>Last night I presented my first session on "Secrets of the Browser Developer Tools" at AKQA Anoraks, and I also took the opportunity to publicly announce the availability of the site.</p>

<p>I've spoken at AKQA Anoraks a few times before, and it's great to see a audience receptive to the talk I was giving. At the start of the talk I asked how many people were using each of the Browser Developer Tools as their primary development tool. The rough results of the survey, bearing in mind I was counting fast, were as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Firebug: 12</li>
    <li>Firefox: 0</li>
    <li>Chrome: 40</li>
    <li>Opera: 0</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer: 1</li>
    <li>Safari: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>Chrome Developer Tools have by far the best feature set, and it appears developers are aware of this with their strong alliance with the browser. Or, could it be that the number of presentations, talks and videos on Chrome Dev Tools far outweighs any of the competition?</p>

<p>Regardless, <a href="http://andi.so/dtspaa" target="_blank">here are the slides for last nights talk</a>. If you'd like me to talk at your event - whether it's a meetup, conference or learning session - <a href="http://www.andismith.com/contact" target="_blank">please get in contact</a>!</p>
